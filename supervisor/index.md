## Nicholas Bannan
### university of western australia


Biography
Nicholas Bannan's earliest musical experience was as a chorister at Canterbury Cathedral. He went on to study Music at Cambridge University, where he specialised in vocal studies and composition. He has taught in several schools, including Eton College and the Yehudi Menuhin School. He was Director of Music at Desborough School, Maidenhead, where the choir he conducted was in demand to work with London orchestras and made frequent broadcasts on television and radio. He continued to develop his work as a composer, winning the Fribourg Prize for Sacred Music in 1986 and completing commissions for the Allegri and Grieg Quartets, the Guildhall String Ensemble, Cantemus Novum of Antwerp, and the Gentlemen of St Paul's Cathedral. He was for 12 years the conductor of The Esterhazy Singers, a London chamber choir that specialised in performing the music of Haydn and his contemporaries with the period instruments of the Esterhazy Chamber Orchestra. He also directed the contemporary music groups 1913 Ensemble and Act of Creation, and worked on electro-acoustic projects with the composer Rolf Gehlhaar and the Elektrodome company. He was a Winston Churchill Fellow in 1992, travelling through the USA in preparing a report on the training of choral directors and singing teachers.
His interests as an educator focused increasingly on means of releasing children's creativity, and he formed the partnership Compose Yourself! to provide workshop opportunities for pupils and in-service training for teachers. He carried out research at the University of Reading into the use of electronic resources in vocal education and the means by which vocal potential can be released in singers of all ages and abilities, and this has led to his Harmony Signing project, a new pedagogical system for developing aural sensitivity and creative potential through group singing. He has also worked with Alzheimer’s patients on the potential of singing for retaining social communication between carers and people with dementia. He was awarded his doctorate in 2002 for a study of the evolutionary origins of the human singing voice. From 1999 to 2005 he was Director of the Music Teaching in Professional Practice Initiative, a distance-learning programme leading to Diploma and Masters qualifications administered at the University of Reading.
Nicholas was founder-editor of the journal Mastersinger published by the Association of British Choral Directors, and Artistic Director of ABCD’s 1996 conference in Oxford. He co-edited the Ashgate publication "The Reflective Conservatoire" with George Odam (2005), and edted for Oxford University Press a book entitled "Music, Language and Human Evolution" (2012). He continues to compose, and brings to his teaching the assumption that the purpose of engaging with the music of the past is to develop the confidence and fluency to enable original self-expression. He is currently completing a book, "Every Child a Composer", that interprets his experience of the evolutionary psychology of music in relation to new pedagogical approaches and advocacy for music in schools.
Nicholas set up The Winthrop Singers in 2007 as UWA's élite chamber choir.  The group performs choral evensong every Thursday in term-time in the Chapel of St George's College, and has toured to Albany, Kalgoorlie, Geraldton and Beijing as well as recording four CDs.
Nicholas spent 2015 on research leave during which he worked at Oxford University as a guest at the Department of Evolutionary Psychology; and visited several Departments of Music in the USA, including the Juilliard School, Eastman, University of Washington, UCLA and USC.
Roles and responsibilities
Musical Director of The Winthrop Singers; Graduate Research Co-ordinator, School of Music; Co-ordinator for Music Education
Future research
Nicholas has commenced practical and historiographic
investigation of chant in the liturgies of the Christian tradition, focusing on the regular performances of The Winthrop Singers.  His existing work on the evolution of the human capacity for music illustrates that chant may be at the root of human cultural attributes, including language. He is collaborating with colleagues at UWA and internationally on a project to model the evolutionary origins of music, art and religion. He is also working on projects with research students such as: the musical theories of Martin Luther; the recorded legacy of performance of Tudor choral music; the implications for secondary music in WA of Australia's new National Curriculum; and the production of a reduced orchestration of Schoenberg's "Erwartung"; and with a variety of Masters and Doctoral students on aspects of performativity and the relationship between musical technique and expressivity.
Previous positions
Director, 'Music Teaching in Professional Practice' Masters programme, University of Reading, UK 1999-2005.  Former Musical Director, the Esterhazy Singers.
Current projects
Completing follow-up work on topics emerging from "Music, Language and Human Evolution"; working on archival material relating to the role of music in the life and writing of Charles Darwin; developing a testable model of the development of the capacity for language out of an existing vocal 'song' system; evaluating the perception of meaning in song and speech; developing innovative pedagogy for aural discrimination and musicianship.

## michael webb
### university of sydney
I am a music historian specializing in Melanesian / Western Pacific musical cultures past and present, and a music educationist with a particular interest in the classroom transmission of musical knowledge. I grew up in Papua New Guinea in the 1960s and 1970s and worked there as a secondary and tertiary educator in the 1980s. As an undergraduate I studied ethnomusicology with Alan Marett; Mark Slobin supervised my MA (1990) and PhD (1995) in ethnomusicology at Wesleyan University, Connecticut, USA. I am at present completing a book, 
Choral Islands:
Protestant Hymnody and Social Transformation in Melanesia from 1835.



	Some of my Vanuatu research has been captured in a documentary film, 
Circling Around in Song
(2017), which was prompted by the discovery in the Maskelyne Islands of a song-and-dance tradition based on African-American Jubilee songs from the 1870s. I am also currently exploring musical aspects of what has been referred to as the ‘Black Pacific’, as well as the musical legacy of the Australian South Sea Islanders.



	I authored
Lokal Musik: Lingua Franca Song and Identity in Papua New Guinea
, the first monograph (1993) on Melanesian popular music, co-authored 
Music in Pacific Island Cultures: Experiencing Music, Expressing Culture
 (OUP 2011), and have published articles on Melanesian music in
Ethnomusicology
(2011)and
The Contemporary Pacific
(2016).



	My first published article (1986, in the 
International Journal of Music Education
) was on bi-cultural music education in Papua New Guinea. In the late 1990s I established the ensemble WorldView, probably the first ensemble in an Australian secondary school dedicated to the performance of world music. My writing and thinking relating to music education has appeared in 
The British Journal of Music Education

## catherine ingram
### university of sydney
Catherine Ingram (英倩蕾) is an ethnomusicologist and an ethnographer of contemporary Chinese culture. Her main focus is Chinese musical culture, and especially the music of China’s minority groups. She is the first non-Chinese to complete substantial research into Kam (in Chinese, Dong 侗) minority song—including study of Kam “big song,” the important Kam song genre that was inscribed on 
UNESCO’s Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009
 and that was the focus of her doctoral research (Ethnomusicology/Chinese studies, University of Melbourne, 2010). Before commencing a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of Sydney in late 2014, Catherine was a Newton International Fellow at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS, University of London, 2013-2014), a Research Fellow at the International Institute of Asian Studies (University of Amsterdam, 2011), and an Endeavour Australia Cheung Kong Research Fellow (Research Institute for Ritual Music in China, Shanghai Conservatory of Music (上海音乐学院), 2010-2011).



	Since 2000 Catherine has spent many years working and conducting research in China. As part of her research she was invited to sing with Kam friends and teachers in many performances of various Kam musical genres, and learnt to speak a dialect of the Kam language (a Tai-Kadai language with no widely used written form and completely different from Chinese). Her research into and involvement in Kam music-making have featured in a range of Chinese print, broadcasting and online media, including in two documentaries produced by Guizhou Province TV, China (
2006
, 
2011
).



	In Australia, the courses that Catherine has lectured include The Ethnography of Music, The Politics of Gender in East Asia and Human Rights in East Asia. In 2014, she was visiting lecturer for a five-part bilingual English/Chinese postgraduate seminar series on musical ethnography at the Research Institute for Ritual Music in China 
(
Shanghai Conservatory of Music). She has delivered guest lectures at SOAS (University of London, UK); Leiden University (The Netherlands); the Interdisciplinary Center for East Asian Studies at Goethe University (Frankfurt, Germany); Shanghai Conservatory of Music (China); Guangxi University for Nationalities (广西民族大学, China); National Chengchi University (國立政治大學, Taiwan); National Tsinghua University (國立清華大學, Taiwan); University of Hong Kong (香港大学); and the Melbourne Conservatorium of Music and the Asia Institute at the University of Melbourne. She was also English lecturer at Central South University (中南大学), China, from 2001-2003.

	Catherine’s research has focussed on diverse aspects of the music of Kam minority communities in southwestern China, where she has conducted extensive musical ethnographic fieldwork. Key interests include:



		China and Chinese musical cultures, especially the music of China’s minority groups

		Collaborative ethnomusicological research methods

		Fieldwork incorporating digital technology; sustainable digital archiving; and cross-cultural collaborative archive management

		Gendered music-making and sociocultural change

		Intangible cultural heritage

		Linguistics and music – especially the music of tonal-language-speaking communities

		Minority music-making

		Music and environmental knowledge

		Musical ethnography

		Research ethics

		The anthropology of musical tradition



	Her recent publications include 
Environmental Preservation and Cultural Heritage in China
 (co-authored with Anne McLaren, Alex English and He Xinyuan), and 
Taking Part in Music: Case Studies in Ethnomusicology
 (co-edited with Ian Russell), amongst others. In 2011 she received the inaugural Nadel Essay Prize from 
The Asia Pacific Journal of Anthropology 
for her article “
Tradition and Divergence in Southwestern China: Kam Big Song Singing in the Village and on Stage
”.



	Catherine has also collaborated with members of Kam communities to produce several co-presentations and four co-publications (
Ingram et al. 2011a
; Ingram et al. 2011b; Ingram and Wu Zhicheng 2014; Ingram and Wu Jiaping forthcoming), and to establish a digital collection of sustainably archived recorded material and metadata, hosted with the Pacific and Regional Archive of Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures (
PARADISEC
). Her work aims to benefit Kam communities by creating valuable written and audio-visual records, producing analyses which demonstrate the richness and significance of Kam music-making, and making indigenous Kam views known to a wider audience.



	Catherine’s postdoctoral research at the University of Sydney will explore and compare the musical activities of cultural minorities in Australia and China, looking especially at the role of music in asserting agency and enabling social engagement. As further detailed 
here
, she will be undertaking musical ethnographic research with Kam and Zhuang communities in China and South Sudanese migrant communities in Australia on a project entitled 
The Music-Making of Cultural Minorities in Australia and China: Aesthetics, Agency and Social Engagement
.

## April Henderson
### victoria university of wellington
Tēnā koe. I am currently Programme Director of Va'aomanū Pasifika—Programme in Pacific Studies and Samoan Studies, and serve on the School of Languages and Cultures Management Committee.

A sustained focus of my scholarship to date is the circulation of music and performing and visual art forms between the US, the Pacific Islands, and Aotearoa New Zealand. This work uses multi-sited ethnographic approaches—following things, people and ideas across time and geography—to understand Pacific aspirations, representations, contexts and practices and to illuminate their political, economic, and social stakes. This research has long fed into my teaching of courses that focus on themes of migration, diaspora, identity, artistic practice, activism, and globalisation and popular culture. More recently, I've branched into a new research stream, funded by a Marsden FastStart research grant, exploring people's meaning-making about Pacific Islands coconut commodities in both their Pacific contexts of production and international sites of consumption.

In addition to my own research, an essential part of my scholarly work involves facilitating the development and publication of Pacific research by others, most notably through supervision of postgraduate students and by creating publication opportunities for Pacific scholars in internationally ranked peer-reviewed journals and my book series Indigenous Pacifics, co-edited with Professor Noelani Goodyear-Ka‘ōpua (U Hawai’i Press). From my location in Pacific Studies, I consider the nurturing of new and emerging researchers—particularly those of indigenous Pacific descent—to be a core responsibility of my work and, alongside my own publications, an important indication of my scholarly impact.

I gained my qualifications at Pitzer College (Anthropology: advisor Donald Brenneis), the University of Hawai'i at Mānoa (Pacific Islands Studies: MA thesis committee members Terence Wesley-Smith, Geoff White, and Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard), and the University of California, Santa Cruz (History of Consciousness: PhD thesis committee members James Clifford, Angela Y. Davis, Neferti X. Tadiar, and Herman Gray). My approach to the interdisciplinary field of Pacific Studies, and much of my learning and teaching philosophy, is shaped by fifteen years spent working alongside the founding Programme Director of Pacific Studies at Victoria University of Wellington, the late Teresia Teaiwa. It is both my responsibility and privilege to carry these critical intellectual genealogies into the classroom and my supervision work, sharing tools with the students who will shape not only the future of our academic fields, but the contours of our worlds beyond.

## Inge van Rij
### victoria university of wellington
Inge van Rij (PhD, University of Cambridge) is an historical musicologist specialising in nineteenth-century European art music. Her research has presented new perspectives on the works of canonic composers such as Brahms and Berlioz in major monographs for Cambridge University Press. In these texts as well as in articles for journals such as 19th-Century Music, Music & Letters and Cambridge Opera Journal, she also explores historical musical practices in broader cultural context, drawing on literary studies, gender studies, history, museum studies, and postcolonial perspectives to put European and American perspectives in dialogue with the historical musical cultures of Australasia. Her current research project, funded by her second Marsden Grant from the Royal Society of New Zealand, brings several of these strands together to investigate the role of women in orchestral cultures in Europe, the United States, Australia and New Zealand.

Inge has served on a range of panels and committees at a national and international level, including the PBRF panel for Creative and Performing Arts (2018), and the executive committee of the New Zealand Musicological Society, of which she has also been the President. Inge has also been a member of the Comité de lecture of the Revue de Musicologie, as well as acting as a reader for a number of international publishers.
